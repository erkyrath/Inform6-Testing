This is version 6.12.5 of the Inform Library,
Copyright Graham Nelson 1993-2004, David Griffith 2012-2021
Full release notes and instructions are available at

and

The Library files here are all lower-case.  For operating systems that
default to case-sensitive filesystems, symbolic links for the
semi-standard capitalizations should be created upon installation.
These capitalizatons are English.h, Grammar.h, Parser.h, Verblib.h, and
VerbLib.h.

For use on operating systems where the standard filesystems are either
case-insensitive or case-preserving but do not distinguish between
uppercase or lowercase, then such symbolic links must not be made or
else a situation where a link points to itself will occur.

Commonly-encountered operating systems that use case-sensitive
filesystems as a rule include Linux, BSD, and most other flavors of
Unix.  Those in the second category include DOS, Windows, AmigaOS, and
MacOS (even though it's derived from FreeBSD).
