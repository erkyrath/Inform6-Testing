! ext_cheap_scenery.h, a library extension for PunyInform by Fredrik Ramsberg
!
! This library extension provides a way to implement simple scenery objects
! which can only be examined, using just a single object for the entire game.
! This helps keep both the object count and the dynamic memory usage down.
!
! To use it, include this file after globals.h. Then add a property called
! cheap_scenery to the locations where you want to add cheap scenery objects.
! You can add up to ten cheap scenery objects to one location in this way. For
! each scenery object, specify, in this order, one adjective, one noun, and one
! description string or a routine to print one. Instead of an adjective, you
! may give a synonym to the noun. If no adjective or synonym is needed,
! use the value CS_NO_ADJ (=1) in that position. You can also give
! CS_PARSE_NAME (=2) as the adjective value and give a routine which will
! act as a parse_name routine in the noun position. Finally, you can give
! CS_ADD_LIST (=3) as the adjective value and then an object ID and a
! property name, to include the cheap scenery list held in that property in
! the object in the current list.
!
! Note: If you want to use this library extension is a Z-code version 3 game,
! you must NOT declare cheap_scenery as a common property, or it will only be
! able to hold one scenery object instead of ten.
!
! If you want to use the same description for a scenery object in several
! locations, declare a constant to hold that string, and refer to the constant
! in each location.
!
! Before including this extension, you can also define a string or routine
! called SceneryReply. If you do, it will be used whenever the player does
! something to a scenery object other than examining it. If it's a string, it's
! printed. If it's a routine it's called. If the routine prints something, it
! should return true, otherwise false. The routine is called with three
! parameters - word1, word2 and routine. These hold:
! * If the cheap scenery object was matched using a parse_name routine, and this
!     routine set cs_parse_name_id = n, then word1 = CS_PARSE_NAME, word2 = 0,
!     routine = n. The value n should be in the range 1-600.
! * If the cheap scenery object was matched using a parse_name routine, and this
!     routine did not set cs_parse_name_id, word1 = CS_PARSE_NAME,
!     word2 = 0 and routine = [routine address] (If you use a named routine,
!     the name is a constant equal to the routine address).
! * Otherwise, word1 = adjective, word2 = noun (the values given in the cheap
!     scenery property for the item matched) and routine = 0.
!
! Example usage: (from howto/cheapscenerydemo.inf in PunyInform distribution)

! ! Cheap Scenery Parse Name constants. Use values 1-600.
